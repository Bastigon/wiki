## The M17 Protocol

M17 is an RF protocol that is:

* Completely open: open specification, open source code, open source hardware, open algorithms. Anyone must be able to build an M17 radio and interoperate with other M17 radios without having to pay anyone else for the right to do so.
* Optimized for amateur radio use.
* Simple to understand and implement.

The specification for the M17 Protocol can be viewed at [https://spec.m17project.org](https://spec.m17project.org)
